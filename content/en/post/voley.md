After a while getting into the world of volleyball in the United
Kingom, I can finally tell you how you live and play here, in
comparison with Spain. There are many different things and at many
levels, both players, competitions and refereeing.

To begin with, one thing that caught my attention and that I did not
know until a couple of months ago, is that there is no **national**
federation, as we understand it in Spain. That is, there is no
*Volleyball Federation of the United Kingdom*. This is because at
international level, the United Kingdom does not compete as such, but
each of The Four Nations: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Although I've been told that in some competitions, such as
the Olympic Games they do compete as one nation ([Team GB][Teamgb]).
It is a mess, even for themselves. As I am in Bristol, I am under the
remit of [Volleyball England][ve], which is the Federation of England.

# Competitions and Leagues

The volleyball level here is a bit lower than in Spain. However, what
I noticed is that there is **a lot** of volleyball. In addition to the
national leagues, there's local and regional leagues, plus all kinds
of tournaments… The vast majority of the participants are
senior. There is almost no base sport, at least in my surroundings.

## Federated Leagues

We have [4 federated divisions][NVL] (I repeat: at least, in England), in
the <acronym title = "National Volleyball League"> NVL </acronym>

- **Super 8s**: As the name implies, 8 teams participate. They compete
  In a first league round, with 14 days, and then there is a
  Play-off round, which ends with the Final Four in the _National
  Volleyball Center_, in Kettering (yes, curiously the national headquarters are not
  in London).
- **Division 1**: Covers all of England
- **Division 2**: It is divided into 2 groups, North and South
- **Division 3**: Divided into 3 groups: North, Central and South

If someone is interested, you can check online [the composition of the
groups][groups], and all the [NVL regulations][regulations].

Division 1, 2 and 3 are played like in Spain: first a league phase and
then play-offs to go up (or down), although the latter are simpler and
I think they are go to a single game.

## National Cup and Shield

This is another federated competition; It would be something like the
Cup of England. It's played in a knock-out format and it's _open_, so
any team can register to play (both federated aand not federated;
i.e. it is not a requirement to participate in the NVL to compete in
the National Cup).

The "Cup and Shield" name is because there are two tiers: Superleague
and Division 1 teams play the **Cup**, whereas teams in Div2, Div3 and
any other teams play the **Shield**. Competitions usually start in
October and all the Cup/Shield Finals are in April, along with other
competition finals (U19, U16, etc).

## Non-federated Leagues

In addition to federated competitions, there are also unofficial
leagues.  Clubs have created their own associations, and organize
several minor leagues. In my region, we have two:

The **Local League**, organized by the [Bristol and District
Volleyball Association][badva]. It is a league focused on Bristol with
teams from the surrounding areas, such as Bath, Cardiff, Cheddar…
There are several teams from the 2 local universities (who usually
don't have lots of skills) and teams of veteran people (who have lots
of skills, but their physique is no longer what was). It is a league
oriented more to initiation and/or recreational volleyball, more than
competitive. There are 3 categories: men, women and mixed.

On the other hand, we have the **Southwest League**, organized by the
[South West Volleyball Association][swva]. This is a better league,
more competitive. Teams from all the South West participate (Bristol,
Plymouth, Exeter, Yeovil, Torexe…). Here we play a league, all vs all;
and then, in May there's the Southwest championships (*Southwest
Champs*), which is a two-days "end of season" open tournament (you
don't need to qualify to play, just be fast and lucky when registering).

## Non-federated tournaments

There are also several tournaments throughout the year, organized by
the clubs. I mean large tournaments, not like the ones we do like
"Villa Miguelturra" or the "Ernesto Arévalo Trophy", for which we have
trouble finding teams. These are tournaments in which people **want**
to sign up, and with this I mean there are usually more teams than
slots, and people enter a waiting queue.

- [Veterans Tournament][veterans]: For players over 35, mixed
  category. It is mandatory to have at least 2 women on court at all
  times. It is held at the end of November, and organized by the
  <acronym title="south west Volleyball Association ">SWVA</acronym>.
- [Cardiff Open][cardiff-open]: I couldn't play it yet, it was
  cancelled this year due to logistics problems. It's usually two
  days, one for women and one for men.
- [Exeter challenge][exeter-challenge]: another _open_ of one day, this
  time in exeter.
- [Whitefield Tournament][Whitefield]: Organized by the _City of
  Bristol Volleyball Club_, it's the biggest volleyball (grass)
  tournament in the United Kingdom, with 30 courts. It is played over
  3 days (Friday to Sunday) at end of July. There are 3 categories
  (men, women and mixed), and in each of them there are between 2 and
  4 divisions (levels), depending on the number of registered teams.

As a curiosity, both the South West Champs, and the Veterans
Tournament and Exeter Challenge are played **by time**. The number of
participating teams makes it impossible to play by points, due to the
number of matches. It starts at some time and you play for 17
minutes. The team that scored the most points at the end of those 17
minutes, wins. It can be a draw. In the Veterans tournament, each team
gets some starting points (handicap) based on the ages and gender of
the players).

It's funny; at first it is a bit strange, but you get used to
it. The worst is the cycle of warmup-getcold-warmup, which is not good
for the knees, but it is what it is.

# Refereeing

Refereeing is also a bit different here. Not that the rules are
different, of course, but there are many things that are done in
another manner. To begin with, only two referees are sent to each
game; scorer and line judges are provided by the home team. And yes,
line judges are used in **all** categories, from NVL to local
league. Well, in the non-federated leagues, referees are not qualified
refs, the teams referee each other (each day is a triangular, and the
team that is not playing, referees), but they also use line judges.

The referees do not have to worry about having scoresheets, or any
documents. It is the responsibility of the home team to supply the
scoresheet, the rotation slips, a pressure gauge, a pump and flags for
the linesmen, and a whole lot more things. Interestingly, water for
players is not included in the game requirements, each team cares for
themselves.

If a team is late, the game is not forfeited: you can wait for up to
20 minutes to arrive. If they appear (ready to play), they can
start. If more than 20 minutes pass, they lose *only the first set* 25-0, and
there are another 20 minutes for the 2nd set, and so on.

One thing that is better here is the appointments. We use a website
[whosotheref.com](www.whostheref.com), in which referees register and
we must give availability (this is done in summer and you specify the
whole season). Then, mails will arrive with appointments and you have
to accept or reject them. If you reject, you must give a reason. In
July/August you get a lot of designations, for the whole season, and
then even more arrive during the season. If something arises, there is
no problem to cancel, so long as you give enough notice (this means
weeks, not a couple of days) so that another referee can be found. The
teams can also be registered on the web and from there they can
request referees for their friendly tournaments or games, for
example. On the web you can check all appointments for all the
competititons, data and addresses of the teams and venues, etc. The
web is quite simple (there's lots of room for improvement) and I miss a mobile
app, but in general it works quite well.

Referees here earn much less than in Spain. This is the table with
the refereeing fees:

Matches                | Category | Fee
---:                   | :---:    | :---:
Single game            | Super 8s | £ 20
                       | Div 1    | £ 17
                       | Div 2    | £ 17
 			           | Div 3    | £ 15
Two triangular games   | Div 2    | £ 40
                       | Div 3    | £ 36
All 3 triangular games | Div 3    | £ 55
Cup and Shield         | Rounds   | £ 17
                       | Semis    | £ 20
Any competition        | Final    | £ 25

Referee grades are also a bit different, but I won't get into that
because we are too few (we need a lot more referees) so it's not very
strict. For example, in February and March I have a couple of Div 1
matches (which would be the equivalent of Super League-2 in Spain). I
shouldn't be there, but… there's not enough people.
