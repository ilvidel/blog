Today I went to work on the path that runs along the river. I don't
know if it rained upstream last night or something, but the river was
really really full. I mentioned it at work, and a colleague told me
that it's because of the tide, and that there's a really cool thing
called a [tidal bore][bore]. Here they call it *the Severn bore*
(because it happens on river Severn). Here's how it works:

If you look at a map of England, you'll see a large channel in the
southwest. That's the Bristol Channel and river Severn. When the tide
comes in, the current goes backwards, upstream, and because the
channel has that wedge/funnel shape, a wave forms. As it narrows, the
water can't be compressed, so it goes where it has room: up. That way,
little by little, a wave forms. It's a single wave, traveling up the
river.

Since tides aren't all the same, the wave is sometimes higher and
sometimes lower. There are some websites where you can see the hourly
forecast, and they even mark them according to the height they will
reach (they rate them from 1 to 5 stars). Apparently, the big ones
make quite a sound as they move forward, and even overflow their banks
when they hit the riverbank at the meanders.
