One of the things I like to visit (and that, ironically, I never do)
is castles. Alonside cathedrals, they seem to me pharaonic endeavours,
for the amount of work that building something like this entails: they
must resist sieges and attacks, and serve as housing. I guess it was
easier to build them then, when there were no labour rights and workers
were mainly slaves.

The thing is that I've visited [Berkeley Castle][Wiki]. It's been in
the Berkely family practically since its construction in the XI
century (making it contemporary of the castles of Calatrava in Ciudad
Real; only this one is not in ruins), and the family still inhabits
it. This makes it one of the few castles that have been continuously
(and still are) inhabited in England, and it's the third oldest of
them.

As a good fortress castle, it sits atop of a hill, so that in case
the enemy comes (usually the Welsh), to be able to see them from
afar. As a bonus, they would get tired climbing the slope. It is
surrounded by a huge garden in which one of the owners built a
swimming pool for his wife, who liked to swim. They say that in that pool
JFK's brother went skinny dipping, but who know if this is
true or they're just trying to be interesting. The pool is now a
water lillies pond.

The entry of the keep was narrowed to improve its defense: if you make
the door narrower, _the bad guys_ can only enter one by one; and if
they also come with the armor on, they will have even more trouble. In
addition, just past the door there is a hole in the ceiling through
which various things like sand or boiling oil could be poured. The
sand may seem nonsense, but again, if you're wearing armor and it
fills with sand (or freshly cut hairs), we'll see how well you do
fighting the itching and the blisters. The entrance steps are also a
trap: they are carved in such a way that each one has a different
height and inclination, designed to stumble and hinder the enemy.

## Edward II's cell

One of the first rooms you can see is the cell where King Edward II of
England was allegedly imprisoned and assassinated. His wife, who was
French and whom he married in an arranged marriage to ease tensions
between the two kingdoms (as usual), traveled to France to negotiate
a peace treaty in 1325. The traitorous bitch then turned against her
husband: allying herself with a certain Roger Mortimer, she invaded
England in 1326 and beat the shit out of her husband, who ran off with
his tail between his legs to take refuge in Wales. He was captured and
imprisoned for 10 months in this castle (Berkeley) until September 21,
1326, when he was assassinated, _presumably_ on the orders of the new
regime, although it's not entirely clear _(wink, wink)_. There are some
[somewhat murky rumors about his death][death], which I will not
reproduce here.

In a corner of the _Kings' Gallery_ (a passageway filled with paintings
of VIPs), there's an _oubliette_, which is a dungeon similar to a well:
basically, it's a hole in the ground, about 10 meters deep, where
they'd throw you… and forget about you; hence the name (_oublier_
means "to forget" in French).

## The Last Jester

The Great Hall lives up to its name and is the largest in the
castle. As we've seen in so many films and series, it served as a
large event hall (*throne room* style). Today, the castle can be rented
for private events, such as weddings, and I imagine this is where they
take place.

The guide told us a somewhat macabre story about this hall, that of
the last court jester:

Dickey Pearce was the jester to the Earl of Suffolk, and at some
point, he joined the Berkeley family. Jesters, contrary to popular
belief, were accomplished artists and skilled in various disciplines,
such as music, singing, acrobatics, sleight of hand, and
juggling. This one in particular was particularly skilled and famous
throughout much of the kingdom. In 1728, he was performing at an event
in this hall; He climbed onto the minstrels' gallery and perched on
the railing. Bad luck (or perhaps his age, as he was already 63)
caused him to lose his balance and fall.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="true" data-footer="true" data-context="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/149690786@N07/48693745617/in/dateposted-public/" title="31_great-hall-minstrel-gallery"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48693745617_109bd8648b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="31_great-hall-minstrel-gallery"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A sudden deceleration incompatible with life did the rest. The
Berkeley family, ashamed that the kingdom's most famous minstrel 
died in their custody, buried him in the family cemetery, in
St. Mary's Church, a few meters away from the castle. 

That's the official story. It's said, though, that he didn't actually
lose his balance, but was pushed by one of the dinner guests (perhaps
even a member of the Berkeley family, it's not clear). Apparently, the
minstrel mocked him during one of his acts, he took offence, and
decided to exact his revenge right there and then. Apparently, it was
common for jesters to mock the nobility and politicians during their
acts, as stand-up comedians and TV presenters do today, only now it
doesn't cost you your life.

## Queen Elizabeth I

At the end of the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I visited the castle
for a few days. This gives an idea of how important the Berkeleys
were; a queen doesn't just visit some nobodies. During her visit, she
did queenly things, such as admiring the tapestries and paintings,
playing [bowls][bowls] (a kind of pétanque) on the garden lawn, and
hunting deer. Apparently, one day she caught 27 deer in one fell
swoop. This didn't amuse Lord Berkeley very much, but of course,
who'll tell the queen off?

## The castle itself

The castle is quite large, and it's worth wandering around for a long
time. There are countless rooms filled with antique furniture,
tapestries, and paintings, a couple of cupboards, two kitchens, a
"butcher's room" (suspiciously next to the doctor's office), and a
huge garden surrounding the property…

There's a section closed to the public, of course, which is where the
Berkeleys currently reside. The guides tell many, very interesting
stories. I could go on, but this has gotten long enough.
