I'm an emigrant. Or an immigrant, depending on how you look at
it. Both, rather. I came to Bristol to work. I'm going to start this
*blog* to share interesting things about my time in the UK. I'd like
it to serve as a way for my people to know how I'm doing and what I
see and do here, although I hope that doesn't stop them from writing
and/or calling me from time to time.

I don't know how long I'll be able to write this; these things usually
bore me, but I'll try to update it regularly. I've been here for two
months now, and I've already written a few things about this
time. Instead of putting everything together, I'd like to update every
week or two, so I'll put the posts in the queue so they'll upload
automatically.

I hope you read me!
