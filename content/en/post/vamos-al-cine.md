Description: The experience of going to the cinema for the first time in Bristol.

Today I went to the cinema for the first time in Bristol. To see a
movie in original version, of course -and without subtitles-. The
movie was *Deadpool*, and even though I did understand the movie
itself (it's not like it has a very complex plot), I have missed a few
jokes. Some because I did not understand the joke (references to
American/English things that I don't know), and some others because
I couldn not understand shit of what they said.

But anyway, that's not the subject. What I was going to talk about is
the cinema itself, the experience. Here it's not like in Spain, where
there is an oligopoly and all the cinemas agree on prices and there's
no competition. Here, there is. There are several cinemas projecting
the same movie, and at different prices. Sure, okay, in Madrid too,
but how much do prices vary? Here you can see a movie for £5.00 (my
case), for £12 and up to £15. I don't think there are such big
difference in Madrid or Barcelona. And of course, during the short
time when there were two cinemas in Ciudad Real, they never played the
same movies.

Why this great pricing difference? Because of the facilities, I
guess. Someday I will go to the £15 cinemas and tell you. For the
moment, I went to the cheap one, which is also closer. Don't you
believe it was a shabby cinema, it was quite good. It had a
bar, to buy popcorn and snacks, and 3 o 4 screens. It was fine.

As I have not yet been able to open a bank account, because English
restrictions and bureaucracy, *(this is no longer the case, I wrote
this a long time ago)* I couldn't buy the ticket online, so I went to
the box office. The pass began at 20:45, and I arrived at 20:40. I did
not calculate well how long it would take me to arrive, so I was
already thinking I was going to miss the trailers and the
[Movirecord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6_th-5HJwA) bit. So
naive. I'll tell in a bit. 

The guy in the box office told me I could choose a seat, and
asked where I wanted it. "What the hell do I know, man, I don't know
the room", I thought to myself.

- Hall, please. - I replied. After all, it is what I always choose, to
  be able to stretch my legs on the side if there is no space.
- Three rows from the last one seems good?
- Coolio.

And on we go. Well, the movie hadn't started yet. Nor the trailers. I
don't know if it's the same in all cinemas, but in this one, rows are
labeled with letters. Row A was the last one, and it seems to me they
got to N, if I didn't miscount. I started looking for my seat, D14, in
the faint light of the room. There would be about 10 people in the
room, and curiously all gathered in the same area. I went to my row
and I see that the aisle seat (mine) is occupied by some coats, and
there is a caucasic lady and a man of color (black, specifically, this
will be relevant later). I stood there for a moment, thinking, pondering whether
not to bother them and sit on another seat, since there is so much
free space. All in all, the movie must be about to start…

I guess both realized that my seat was that one, so the woman picked
up the coats, while the man got up and asked me If I wanted to pass,
and which my seat was. I told them that my seat was that in the aisle,
and that it was a big coincidency that having so many free seats, they
put the few of us so close together. All this in English, of
course. Anyway, just as I sit the lights dim (yes, they are dimmed,
not turned off) and on the screen, a capital O appears, with an
animated space psychedelic background. After a while looking at it,
and waiting for something to happen, I realize that it was the O for
*Odeon Cinemas*, the name of the cinema. When I left the trance in
which I was plunged by the hypnotic video, I heard the guy (the colored)
say: "Well, five pounds for a movie is cheap." This time, in perfect
Spanish.

- Oh, are you Spanish? -- I asked. Not that I am very interested, but
  just to do some small talk.

They were. It turns out that they were from Galicia, no less. Never
had I seen a Galician black. Nor a black Galician. But hey, I managed
to find one in a cinema in Bristol. And on top of that, in the seat
next to mine. We chatted a little, but soon a voice that flooded the
room began to speak. No, it wasn't God, it was the speakers. Some
instructions appeared on the screen, indicating that we should be
finishing the conversations, sending the last messages and
disconnect the mobiles, because nobody likes to be distracted in the
midst of the movie watching the screen from the mobile in front, on
full brightness.

20:50. Five minutes of the video of the O with ominous music, I remind
you. Ok, the movie is going to start. "Now, some commercials" says the
voice. Alright, let's see some ads. The same ones from TV. 10 minutes
of advertisement, no less! And I was worrying because I was going to
be late. Of course, people here, the native (aborigins, even), already
know it, and they began to arrive now, the bastards. That's why the
room was empty. The voice spoke again, telling us that the trailers
were about to start, especially chosen for this movie. ANOTHER TEN minutes. At least
the trailers, you see with interest.

With one thing and another, half an hour later, the movie started at
21:15.
