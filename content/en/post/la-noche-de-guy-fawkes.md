    Remember, Remember
    The Fifth of November,
    Gunpowder, Treason and Plot.
    We see no reason
    Why Gunpowder Treason
    Should Ever Be Forgot!



These verses, which you'll undoubtedly know from the film [V for
Vendetta][vendetta], are the beginning of a popular British poem about
*the Gunpowder Plot*. On the night of November 5, 1605, a group of
thirteen Catholics attempted to assassinate the Protestant King James
I of England and replace him with his daughter, Princess
Elizabeth. The idea was to blow up Parliament during the inaugural
ceremony.

The conspiracy was brewed for over a year, as the five main criminals
apparently began meeting in various London pubs as early as May 1604
to hatch the plan. One of them, Thomas Percy, managed to infiltrate
*Her Majesty's Bodyguard of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at
Arms*, a kind of bodyguard for the king, which gave them access to the
building. Guy Fawkes posed as Percy's assistant, using the pseudonym
John Johnson (not suspicious at all).

They stored several barrels of gunpowder in a cellar, under some logs
and coal. Guy Fawkes was in charge of lighting the fuse and then
quickly fleeing, crossing the River Thames. But he was
caught. Apparently, some of the plotters weren't entirely convinced by
the plan because several "Catholic comrades" were present at the
opening of Parliament and would also be killed.

On October 26, about ten days before the *explosion*, Sir William
Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, received an anonymous letter that read as
follows:
> My Lord, out of the love I bear to some of your friends, I have a
> care of your preservation. Therefore I would advise you, as you
> tender your life, to devise some excuse to shift your attendance
> at this parliament; for God and man hath concurred to punish the
> wickedness of this time. And think not slightly of this
> advertisement, but retire yourself into your country where you may
> expect the event in safety. For though there be no appearance of
> any stir, yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow this
> Parliament; and yet they shall not see who hurts them. This
> counsel is not to be condemned because it may do you good and can
> do you no harm; for the danger is passed as soon as you have burnt
> the letter. And I hope God will give you the grace to make good
> use of it, to whose holy protection I commend you.

The baron alerted other barons and nobles, although they decided not
to tell the king, who was hunting in Cambridgeshire, and apparently
that was more important. Nobles things. Although the plot had been
discovered, no details were really given, and the conspirators decided
to go ahead with the plan, thinking the letter would be ignored as a
false alarm or a hoax.

However, as we know, they were eventually caught. Guy Fawkes, since he
was in charge of the explosives, was caught red-handed. As news of his
arrest spread, the rest of the conspirators began to flee London, but
were pursued and arrested, except for two of them, including Thomas
Percy (the infiltrator), who were shot dead while being pursued.

After the trial, they were found guilty of high treason, as expected,
and sentenced to be *hanged, drawn, and quartered* (they weren't
messing around). Guy Fawkes was lucky enough to break his neck on the
gallows, and was spared the hardships of the rest of the
sentence. Percy and the other were "getting off easy" because they
were already dead, but their bodies were still exhumed and
decapitated, and their heads were put on spikes and publicly displayed
outside the House of Lords.

# Celebration

Today, the fact that they were caught and the king saved his life is
commemorated (British are generally quite monarchical). That's why
effigies of Guy Fawkes are burned in public places and fireworks are
set off.

On Saturday the 5th, I went to referee in Cardiff, and on the way back
we saw lots of fireworks everywhere. In addition to the "official"
ones, people buy their own fireworks and set them off in the park or
in their gardens. They were setting off fireworks from 5:30 p.m. until
late at night, around 10:00 p.m.

Bonfires are also built (if possible) in the garden, and people eat
marshmallows (the famous "marshmallows" seen in American movies when
they go camping). You toast it so it's warm and half-melted, and you
eat it. It's like putting a tablespoon of sugar in your mouth.

A colleague from work invited us over to his house, and we had dinner
(at 7 p.m., of course), drinking some wine and/or beer and
chatting. Then we made the marshmallows in a stove (there was no place
for a fire) and even had some fireworks.
