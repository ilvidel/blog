I just got back from Mass. And no, it's not that I've suddenly become
a believer or a practicing church. I went to see one of the many
churches in Bristol, but when I arrived they were in Mass. I waited
outside for a while, but they were taking a long time, so I thought
I'd wait outside instead.

I went in and sat at the back, and I watched what the Mass was
like. It was odd because they spent most of the time singing. In
Spain, I've visited many old churches and cathedrals like this one,
from the Middle Ages, and they're all the same: a cross-shaped floor
plan, lectern, pulpit, choir stall, altar... Some, like this one, have
organs. The odd thing is that most of them no longer use almost any of
these things. Well, here they do. The choir is used, and the
*choristers* (well, let's call them "choir members") sit in the pews
with their robes and everything. And the organ is used too—apparently,
it's one of the best in the UK. It's all very medieval. I didn't see
anyone at the pulpit, so I don't know if they use it.

Once the ceremony was over, I grabbed a guidebook and took a look
around the church. They know it's a tourist attraction, so they have a
sort of information center and souvenir shop on the far side of the
altar. I won't tell you about the church because… well, it's more or
less like all the other churches of its style. 14th century, Gothic
style, etc., etc. You can see the photos on [Flickr][flickr]. It did
have some interesting things, such as a [chaotic pendulum][chaotic],
which is something you normally find in some kind of museum or
scientific exhibit, not in a church.

This one was also quite interesting. For those who don't know… well,
we all know what a [pendulum][pendulum] is, right? One of the
properties of a pendulum is that it's a deterministic system; that is,
knowing the initial conditions, you can predict what its state
(position) will be at any given time by applying a series of
equations. On the contrary, a chaotic pendulum is not deterministic;
you can't predict its behavior. An example of this is the [double
pendulum][double], which is quite simple and intuitive. The one in the
church is a bit more complex (see video).

The oscillating tube has an opening in the center, through which water
enters. The water moves through the inside of the tube and exits at
the ends, is collected, and is reintroduced into the tube. Depending
on which side of the tube the water flows, it will cause the tube to
tilt to one side or the other. You might think that once it tilts, it
would stay that way, with the water flowing to that side. But since
the weight of the water isn't significant enough compared to the tube,
it tends to return to a position of equilibrium, which is again
disturbed by the flow of water. You see, very curious, a science
lesson in a church.

Continuing with the visit, I saw the organ (although I couldn't
photograph the pipes), the many tombs there were (both on the floor
and in sarcophagi on the wall), etc. I was very struck by the number
of stained-glass windows, and they were very beautiful and
colorful. The guidebook said that only one of the originals remained;
the others were broken during the wars and had to be restored (that's
the thing about glass and explosions; they don't mix well).

Another very curious thing that was there was a jaw bone of a whale. A
pretty small one, to be honest, but okay. In the church there's a
model of a ship, the [Matthew][matthew], a caravel that traveled in
1497 from Bristol to Newfoundland. Apparently, there's a life-size
replica in the port; I'll go see it one day. Apparently, a certain
*John Cabot* wanted to imitate Columbus and reach Asia, traveling
north; but he ran into America, of course. On the return trip, the guy
cut off this whale jawbone. I don't know what it's doing in the
church; they don't explain it, but it's there.

Outside in the garden, there was something that also caught my eye: a
piece of tram track embedded in the grass. There used to be a tram,
but they removed it (damn, I would have loved to ride it). And what's
that doing stuck there? It turns out that during World War II, a bomb
blew that piece of track over the neighboring houses, and it ended up
embedded in the ground. And they left it there as a souvenir.
