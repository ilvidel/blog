As some of you may know, a few days ago I went to visit
Stonehenge. It's about 70 km from Bristol, so I had two options:
either take a bus/train to Salisbury and then a bus or something, or
rent a car. Public transport takes three hours to get there, so I
opted for a car. It was quite interesting to have the steering wheel
on the right and drive in the left lane, with the roundabouts running
clockwise, etc.

In the end, it was one of the best parts of the trip, honestly. It
took me an hour and a half to get there, which is a long time for a 70
km trip, but of course... you have to see the roads here. I only took
a couple of stretches of highway; the rest of the way was on what
would be a national road. But don't think about the Spanish national
roads, as we know them. Here, they would be the equivalent of a
regional road. No hard shoulders, for starters; and quite narrow, with
no dividing line in many cases. Although the scenery is spectacular:
all green, endless countryside, trees everywhere... In fact, there
were a couple of stretches where the leaves formed a kind of tunnel
over the road, so lush that even the car's headlights came on, despite
the intense sun. Very beautiful. I would have liked to stop and take a
photo, but you know... hard shoulders... And I'm not like someone we
know who has no problem taking a picture of the speedometer at 150 on
the Ciudad Real-Cáceres highway and sending it via WhatsApp...

So, after a long drive, a few mistakes at a detour, and hitting my
elbow against the door several times while trying to change gears with
my right hand, I arrived at Stonehenge. The first thing I did, of
course, was go to the bathroom, because I was peeing like a grown-up.

I thought I'd go straight there to the boulders, but no. It turns out
they've set up some kind of National Park. You arrive at a visitor
center, where there's a "restaurant," a gift shop, an exhibit,
etc. The restaurant has quotation marks because they only have cold,
pre-cooked meals, like sandwiches and slices of cake. Incidentally,
since I was hungry and hadn't brought anything to eat, I bought
something: a sandwich, a drink, and dessert, £9. Gosh. Those rocks
better be good.

Next to the visitor center, there's a reproduction of a small village
from that period. You can go inside the houses to see what they were
like on the inside, and they have a [menhir][menhir] with a
[dynamometre][dynamometre] so you can pull and see how lazy you
are. It tells you how many people like you it takes to move it. There
was a long queue to buy tickets, but I didn't see anything stopping me
from going to the stones—they're 2 km from the center, mind you. Thank
goodness there are buses. While I was wandering around and deciding
whether to go directly or buy a ticket (which cost £16, so don't miss
it), there was an explosion. I quickly turned my head toward the
source of the sound, in time to see that one of the tires on one of
those carts used by transport workers had burst. I don't know why,
since I was in the shade. Who knows. Everyone approached, with a
worried face, some with scared expressions, the workers and security
guards talking on their walkie-talkies, and no one understood a
thing. In the end, I had to be the one to tell everyone to calm down,
that it was just the tire, it had blown out. Everyone calmed down,
some tourists looked disappointed, and a woman from the resort thanked
me. She could have given me a free ticket, damn it.

So, I stood in line for 20 minutes to buy my ticket, spent the £16
(well, £11, because they deduct the 5 pounds you pay to use the parking
lot), grabbed the maps and all the other stuff they gave you, and set
off to walk toward the rocks. Anyway, I wasn't in a hurry, and the
weather was good.

I started walking through the field and came to a little sign that
told you that there was something there. Something they call the "Long
Cursus," a rectangular ditch about 3 km long and 100-150 meters
wide. Totally, nothing. In fact, from the ground you can't even see
it; you have to see it in aerial photos and sonar to see that there's
something there. They also don't know what it was for, or why they did
it. Probably to mark the potato bed. The whole park is full of things
like that, little signs that say "there's something here, but we don't
know what it is or what it was used for, and besides, you can't see it
without a helicopter. But you paid us good money for the entrance."
Disappointing.

Well, actually, to "see" these things, you don't need a ticket. You
only need it to get close to the stones. If you don't have a ticket,
the closest you can get is where the bus drops you off. If you have a
ticket, you can go around the cordon around them, and then approach
them to within 10 meters, but you can't walk among them. Apparently,
the only day they allow access is during the summer solstice, when
there's a big party there. Here's a video. In the next town over,
Salisbury, they have a ~sect~ group of druids and
everything. Crazy. Here's a video I found of a sunrise on the solstice
(fast-forward to 4:15).

Once you get there and show the ticket so they can let you in, you
can spend a while reading the signs and wandering around the
boulders. It's fine to pass the time; as long as the weather is
good. Bring a blanket and some tuna tortillas, and you can have a
picnic.

Another thing around the place is *Woodhenge*, which, as its name
suggests, is the same thing but with wood. Supposedly, there were a
ton of wooden poles stuck in the ground, and they were quite tall. Of
course, no one knows what they were for, or anything at all, for a
change. Now, not even the poles (or some reproductions) are there;
there are just some cement blocks to mark where the poles once were.

# A Little Astronomy

I'm going to try to describe what remains of the monument, and how it
is aligned with the sun. If you look at the plan of Stonehenge, the
first thing you think is that it's impossible for it to be aligned
with anything: none of it points to any of the cardinal points. Not
the entrance way, not the station stones, not the altar, nothing. I
stood there for a while thinking about it and couldn't see it. So I've
been doing some astronomical research.

{{< figure src="/img/stonehenge-plano.jpg" footer="En azul, el lugar que ocupa ahora el camino (como véis, el túmulo norte se lo han cargado). Se supone que hay una avenida que sale desde las piedras hacia la *Heel Stone*, pero solo se ve en fotos aéreas." >}}

In blue, the place where the road now stands (as you can see, the
northern barrow has been destroyed). There is supposedly an avenue
leading from the stones to the *Heel Stone*, but it can only be seen
in aerial photos.

The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, but that doesn't mean
it rises at 90° and sets at 180° [azimuth][azimuth]. It turns out that
that only happens at the equinoxes. That point shifts throughout the
year, and also varies depending on the latitude of the location from
which you look.  Specifically, at Stonehenge, on the summer solstice,
the sun rises at about 50°. Of course, now I get the point:

{{< big-figure src="/img/stonehenge-solsticios.jpg" footer="Las piedras en negro son las que aún están en pie. El resto están caídas o, en su mayoría, desaparecidas en combate." >}}

The stones in black are those still standing. The rest have
fallen or, for the most part, gone missing in action.

Indeed, the *Season Stones* are aligned with the seasons: the
northwest, with the summer solstice sunset, and the southeast, with
the winter solstice sunrise. The avenue or processional path leading
into the church, along with the altar and the inner circle (more like
a horseshoe), were aligned with the sunrise on the summer solstice.

Many more fascinating photos of stones, as always, on [Flickr][flickr].
