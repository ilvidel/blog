Computer engineer and volleyball player and referee. Halfway between
_Generation X_ and *Millenials*, and forced migrant. Currently living
in Bristol, where I try to make time and do some tourism every now and
then. Here, I will tell about the places I visit and other interesting
things about living in the UK.
