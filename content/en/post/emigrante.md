I am an emigrant. Or an immigrant, as you look. The two things, more
good. I have come to Bristol to work. I'm going to start this *blog *
To tell here the things that seem curious about me
stay in the United Kingdom. I would like it to serve my people
know how I go and what I see and do here, although I hope that does not
prevents them from writing and/or calling me from time to time.

I don't know how much I will endure by writing this, these things usually
bore, but I will try to update it regularly. I've been two months
Here, and I have some already written things of this time. Rather
put everything together, I would like to update every week or two weeks,
So I will put the * posts * in the tail, so that they leave
climbing alone.

I hope you read me!
