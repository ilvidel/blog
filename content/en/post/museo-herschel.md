Today I returned to Bath to visit the Herschel Museum of Astronomy. I
say "returned" because I was already here a year ago, seeing the Roman
baths and the abbey/cathedral. I haven't written about that yet, I
know. I have it pending. It's not like anyone has complained.

# About Herschel

The museum is housed in the house where William Herschel lived for
almost 20 years in Bath, where he worked as a conductor, his initial
vocation being music. In 1773, he became interested in astronomy after
reading a book on the subject by James Ferguson. The "problem" is that
the book didn't seem to satisfy his curiosity; it didn't give enough
details, and so he decided to build his own telescope to personally
experience what the book taught.

From then on, he began observing the sky and built new, larger, and
more powerful telescopes. He made many discoveries (see Wikipedia),
the most important being the discoveries of Uranus and Neptune. His
expertise as an astronomer was such that King George III himself
recruited him as his personal astronomer.

Herschel built the largest telescope of its time (which remained so
for over 50 years), a refractor with a primary mirror 1.26 m in
diameter and a tube over 12 meters long.

# The Museum

The museum itself is curious, although the name leads to
misunderstanding: it should just be called the Herschel Museum,
because it's more about him and his life than about astronomy. Still,
it's interesting to visit the house where he lived, see the workshop
where he built mirrors and telescopes, the back garden—where he
discovered Uranus—and all his tools and musical instruments.

It's an 18th-century Georgian-style house, which means it's narrow
(only the width of one room) and tall. It had four floors, which must
have been a pain every time you forgot your glasses in the other
room. Downstairs, in the basement, were the workshop and kitchen, with
access to the garden.

On the ground floor, which faces the street (on the other side of the
house, the no (facing the garden), there's what is now the museum's
reception area (we don't know what it was before), where there's a
replica of its telescope and a model of the 40-foot telescope; and the
dining room, which is decorated... well, like a dining room from that
period. There's not much to see there.

On the first floor was the drawing room, where some documents (books,
treaties, letters, etc.) and objects such as a "field telescope" (aka
[spyglass][spyglass]), planetariums, primary and secondary
mirrors... There's also the music room, with a piano (although it's
probably not a piano and has another name, some musician please
correct me), a harp, a _military snake_ (something I've never seen
before), and some other curious things, such as one of the dresses
worn by Carloline Herschel, the astronomer's sister and
assistant/secretary who lived with him.

The second floor was closed and we weren't able to go up, but from a
model (and logically) we assume that the bedrooms were there. We don't
know what's there now.
