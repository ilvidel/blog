A couple of days before going to Spain, I was tired of being locked up
at home. It was a Sunday afternoon, one of those that you do not feel like doing
anything, there is nothing interesting to see or do; so i took the camera
and decided to visit the Arnos Vale cemetery.



Arnos Vale is a neighborhood, or district, or something like that, I'm
not quite sure of the naming convention. The thing is that I saw the
cemetery once from the bus, and the architecture of the buildings that
were at the entrance, which mimicked the Romanesque temples caught my
eye, so I added it to my Google Maps list. Afterwards, I learned that it was
a cemetery. The first time I went to see it I was dissapointed, because It
was closed. They close at five in the afternoon.

So this time I went at around 3, for a walk. And the truth is, it's
very beautiful. It is an ancient cemetery, from the XVIII century and
it must have been active until shortly after World War II, because
those were the most recent tombstones I could see, I think.

The problem is that it has not had proper maintenance. Nor was it
organized like the cemeteries we are used to seeing, it seems that
they fenced a piece of a hill, they threw a stone and where it landed,
there went the grave. The good part (at least, for me) is that this
neglect allowed nature to take over the tombs, and grow everywhere.

Many tombstones are broken or clapped-out, full of vines, roots, etc.,
which surely at night gives it a very interesting look, mwhaahahaaaâ€¦

There is not much more to describe, really. It is best to go see it In
person, walk along the paths between tombs and trees, and enjoy it in
person. I leave you a video, and as always, some photos on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/149690786@n07/albums/72157673477840983)
