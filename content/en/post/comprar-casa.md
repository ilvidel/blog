I recently bought a house here in Bristol. The dump I was renting was
getting too small, and if I want to pay someone else's mortgage, I'd
better pay my own. But it's no small feat. I don't know what it's like
in Spain, because I've never bought a house before—this is my
first—but I'm going to tell you about the hassle of buying a house
here. Let's start at the beginning:

## The Search

The first thing you have to do, obviously, is find a house you
like. Well, prepare yourself psychologically. You're going to want a
decent house, since you're going to pay a fortune. You want it to be
good, it shouldn't be in a state of disrepair (unless you're into that
and want to spend time and money restoring it, of course, there are
people for everything), it shouldn't be too far from work, and it
shouldn't be super expensive. At first glance, these don't seem like
very demanding requirements, do they? Reasonable. Then you can start
asking for extras, of course: a house instead of an apartment, with a
garden, a garage, a pool… But let's start with the basics.

To start with, forget about the city center unless you're willing (and
able) to pay a fortune for another one-bedroom dump. So, living close
to work is out of the question. Now you have to juggle price and
distance. That's when you'll lose your desire.

And the little desire you have left will disappear when you start
looking at houses. The ones you have left, of course. Most English
people (there are exceptions, of course) are, as one of my teachers at
the Language School used to say, "slow-witted." And she didn't say
that because they were slow witted, but because of the filth. You go
to visit the houses and there's mold in almost every bathroom,
dampness, filthy carpets with a life of their own, harboring other
life forms, toys, or any other variety of junk… This last one, well,
okay, it's understandable because when you go to see the houses,
**there are still people living in them**.

That's another thing. Sometimes, I've gone to see a house, bumped into
the real estate agent on the street, and… the owners were still
inside! And what can I say, but going to see a house and finding the
owners (or tenants, it doesn't matter) inside is, to say the least,
uncomfortable. You walk into the bedroom and there's the girl sitting
on the bed, wearing her Pink Panther robe/pajamas, which looks like a
tacky carnival costume. Imagine the scene. It's not pleasant.

Then you'll also find many offers that are too good to be true. And
obviously they are. 4 bedrooms and a garden for £120,000?  Of course,
then you see the photos and you understand. Total ruin. Peeling walls,
broken pipes, broken or missing tiles, the carpet half torn off, the
parquet floor destroyed… and it's being sold at public auction. The
_Breaking Bad_ guys were definitely there.

You might also come across some strange situations. One of the houses
I visited was quite nice, with 3 bedrooms, a garden with a cool porch,
and a good price… But there were a few things that didn't quite add
up: instead of entering from the street, you entered from a back
alley, through a door that led directly to the garden. From there, you
climbed some stairs to the cool porch, which was on the first
floor. And there was the door. I mean, the building had 3 floors, and
the house consisted of the first and second floors. The ground floor
was another address. Also, there was a fence in the garden that led to
the house on the ground floor. And one of the rooms on the ground
floor had windows directly onto "my" garden. What the hell?

It turns out the house belonged to a father and son. The father passed
away, and the son kept the ground floor and refurbished the other two
as a separate address. And of course, architectural
juggling. Apparently, that's quite common here. People have (or
inherit) pretty nice mansions, and they divide them up and sell or
rent them out. One of my friends here lived in one of these houses,
and once moved from the upstairs apartment to the downstairs because
the owner stopped renting one of the addresses and wanted to stay in
the one above.

The thing is, these divisions are sometimes done _in that way_, and
they lead to strange things like having to enter through the back,
having your entrance be the kitchen, or having a hallway that's half
as wide. But these are their customs and they must be respected.

Over time, all this diminishes your expectations: you look further and
further, the distance to work doesn't matter as much anymore, you
consider paying more… Advice: be prepared to spend **months** just
looking and seeing houses; and if you really want something (a garden,
a garage, whatever), don't give up and try to get it. Better to delay
a little longer than to regret it later.

## The Purchase

Congratulations! After spending months looking at listings daily and
knowing the real estate market better than the agents themselves,
you've found the ~~perfect~~ house that best fits your criteria. It's
all a matter of agreeing on a price and moving forward, right? Well,
no.

The house is listed for a price. Let's say £210,000, for example. You
call the agent and tell them, well, the house isn't bad, but the price
is a bit high. Plus, you're going to have to paint, or fix the doors,
or replace the carpet that's disgusting, you throw a ball and it won't
roll, it sticks, or whatever. You offer them £200,000. The agent takes
note and has to contact the owner. Because you don't negotiate the
price with someone directly, whether it's the agent or the owner. They
can't fathom it. That's how it's always been done, and that's how it's
done, and that's it. So you have to wait for the agent to talk to the
owner, call you back, and tell you whether they like it or not. If
they don't like it, they'll just say no. They won't lower the price or
anything. You have to make another offer, if you want. And then wait
again.

Meanwhile, obviously, it's possible that someone else is interested in
the house and is also making offers, of course. But you don't know
what the others are offering, and they don't tell you. It's all in the
dark. Which is stupid. Actual conversation:


<p style="margin:0;">-- Hey, I'm offering 200K.</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- Well, I can tell you that they're going to reject that, because there are people who have offered more and they rejected it.</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- Oh, and what's the maximum they've rejected? How much is the bid?</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- I can't say.</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- Wow. Well, how about I offer 203K?</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- They're going to reject it</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- 204K</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- Same</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- You see where I'm going with this, right?</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- Yes</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- You see, I'm going to find out the price eventually?</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- Yes</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- It doesn't make sense, right?</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- No</p>
<p style="margin:0;">-- So why don't you stop wasting your time, and mine, and tell me?</p>
<p>-- It is what it is</p>

[comment]: <> (insert fuuuuu image or facepalm)

It's normal for someone to outbid you, but it's also possible for you
to…  _underbid_? That is, for the owner to decide to sell
the house to someone else who **offered less than you**. This happened
to me. The guy offered less than me, but he paid in cash (where do
people get so much cash?), so there were no banks, mortgages, or other
such crap to wait for. I guess the owner's eyes were drawn to the
drawings with the dollar sign. Or the pound, in this case.

## The Chain

Okay, after many months, many visits to haunted houses, and much
frustration, you've managed to make an offer on a house you like, and
it's been accepted. Great! That's almost all there, right? Error!  Now
comes the best part: **the chain**.

You're going to buy a house from some guys, who are moving. But
they're not going to start looking until they've accepted an offer. I
mean, even though they know they're moving and have put the house on
the market and everything, they're not going to do anything until you
come up with the money. And of course, they're not the only ones. Now
they're starting to look for a house. And they'll go through the same
hardships you've been through up until now. They'll make an offer. It
will be accepted. And that's when the third in the chain starts
looking for their next house. And so on ad infinitum, until someone
buys a house that's already empty (or is first-hand, for example).

This chain can be as long or as short as you want; there's no
limit. But the worst part is that it can be broken at any moment. If
any of the buyers decides not to go through with the purchase, we're
all screwed; because each one is counting on the money from the sale
of their house to buy the next one. Then everyone in the chain after
the traitor will cancel. And those in the chain before them, well, it
depends on what the person in front does: they can wait for the
traitor to find another house, or they can decide they're tired of
waiting for that person and look for something else. And so on, until
the first in the chain.

## The Investigations

Well, after your offer is accepted (and you're in the chain), the
messy business begins. Find a specialized lawyer, because there are
more procedures to complete than there are stars in the galaxy. Don't
worry, everyone (the real estate agent, the bank, your mortgage
broker…) will want to recommend theirs. It's for commissions and all
that. The scam is the same everywhere.

There are tons of checks to be made: that the property is actually
saleable, that the paperwork is in order, that the plot is what it
claims to be, that no illegal or unauthorized work has been done… The
amount of things is absurd. In fact, there are so many things that
they don't do them all. In the report they send you later, they tell
you to check some things yourself. And some of the things to check are
also absurd.

For example:
- that the curb cut in front of the house was done with permission and
  by someone qualified (and not by the owner himself on a Sunday
  morning with a hammer and a pencil in his ear)
- that the property is in an area where radon gas levels are
  acceptable (WTF?)
- that the construction work for the future high-speed train is not
  planned to run nearby, in case the noise of the trains bothers
  you. Or you don't like trains, or whatever.

All of these are things that **I** should check, apparently. And more
things that I can't remember. It's known that the £1,200 I'm going to
pay them isn't enough to look at that.

As I say, they then send you a report with the results of all these
checks, some of which are also quite striking:

- the property is in a clayey area; if there's a long period of
  drought, the ground could collapse. Keep this in mind in case you
  don't want to go ahead with the purchase for this reason.
- The property is in a former mining area, which could have caused
  damage to the land. Keep this in mind in case you don't want to go ahead with the purchase for this reason.
- The land will be your property, but all mines and minerals found on
  it belong to Bristol City Council. Keep this in mind in case you
  don't want to go ahead with the purchase for this reason.
- Free and uninterrupted access to light and air must be guaranteed at
  all times hereafter over the property to any building that, for a
  period of eighty years from the present date, is erected on the
  adjoining or neighboring land. I have no idea what this means. But
  keep it in mind in case you don't want to go ahead with the purchase
  for this reason.

One thing that also caught my attention is that some houses are sold
"outright": you buy the house, but not the land. And you have to pay
rent for the plot (in addition to the mortgage). That rent isn't
usually much, around £100 or £200 a year, but that's another thing to
pay. As far as I know, that's not the case in Spain, at least not for
residential land. You buy the house and the plot. And if it's in an
apartment building, you own the corresponding percentage.

## The Inspection

Everyone also recommends that you hire a technical inspection of the
house, carried out by an independent company. Like the MOT (Technical
Inspection of the House) for a car, but for a house. A Technical
Inspection of Housing, look, it's even a good fit. It's basically a
guy who will walk around the entire house for a couple of hours,
snooping, and will tell you what problems it has. Or not. Because of
course, in this world of lawyers, no one will ever tell you that the
house doesn't have any problems. Almost everything will be
complemented by _"…but it's possible it won't be visible because
<INSERT YOUR FAVORITE EXCUSE HERE>, so we write it here to cover our
asses and so you don't sue us if we haven't seen it." In other, nicer
words, but basically that's it. Everyone is collecting money for not
guaranteeing anything.

For example: "The walls look fine, but there's wallpaper that could be
hiding some serious structural defect." Well, that's a pain, I already
saw that when I went to see the house. I don't know why I pay an
expert. Mine also told me that the electrical system, boiler (heater),
and all that stuff, always got a red level (the worst in the universe)
because he wasn't qualified to inspect it. Very helpful,
thanks. Here's your 400 pounds.

Based on what Inspector Gadget tells you, you can negotiate the price:
if you see that you need to treat the wood, or do some work, or
whatever, then they'll give you a discount on what it's going to
cost. Maybe they'll give you a discount, or maybe they won't, of
course.

## The Exchange

After all this, and signing more papers than a watermelon has atoms,
all you have to do is wait. And wait. And wait. Wait for the others to
finish their paperwork and dealings, until one day, finally, the
exchange takes place. All participants in the chain must leave their
keys and pick up the new ones on the same day. In the morning, before
a certain time, you leave your keys at the real estate agency managing
your sale, and in the afternoon at a certain time, you pick up the
keys from the real estate agency managing your purchase. What do you
do during those hours, in the meantime? Well, beg on the street, I
don't know. That's how things are organized here. Luckily, since I
wasn't selling and was the first in the chain, I didn't have any
problems; I could stay in my apartment for several more days.

And that's it, once they give you the keys, you can go and face
cleaning the house because they've left without cleaning, repainting,
furnishing, washing the carpets, doing any renovations… but that's
another story.
