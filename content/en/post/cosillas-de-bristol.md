Today I'm not going to talk about anything specific, just a few
comments on various random things I've seen.

Bristol is one of the largest cities in the United Kingdom, by
population. And yet, like in all cities here, the terraced house
culture still predominates. Except for the most central and busy part,
where all the businesses, banks, etc. are, the rest of the city is
made up of single-family homes, terraced houses. That makes the cities
enormous. Huge. Since all the houses are single-family, the population
is spread out, like butter on toast. They are very pretty houses, yes,
with their little front fence, their Simpsons-style windows… All
very Victorian. In fact, most of the houses are from that period,
super old, with wooden floors and everything.

In Victorian times (late 18th and early 19th centuries, for those who
don't know), heating as we know it today didn't exist. The only way to
heat was through fireplaces, so it's not unusual to find at least one
fireplace in every house. Some even have several. This also happened
in London, and in fact, the famous London fogs were almost more
chimney smoke than fog. Today, energy-conscious people are aware of
the issue, and all chimneys are either completely bricked up or
rendered unusable, with a small decorative gap left.

I haven't looked into this, but I'm sure it's by law. Not in the "wall
up your chimney or we'll fine you" sense; but here, all houses have
something called an EPC (Energy Performance Certificate). It's a
rating they give a house based on how well or poorly it's thermally
insulated. That is, how quickly it loses heat. And of course, a
fireplace… well, it's not exactly a good insulator; it's basically a
hole that sucks heat from the room and vents it outside (if it didn't,
smoke would enter the house). So that rating must be quite
low. Surely, the houses with the worst rating have to pay some extra
tax or something, and that's why they wall them up. Shame. A good fire
is so cool. And it makes dinner.

One of the things everyone in Spain usually knows about the English
(and some other European countries) is their schedule. And it's
true. They have a hefty breakfast, stuff themselves in the morning,
and aren't hungry all day, until dinner. At noon (literally, at 12:00;
or at the latest at 1:00 PM), they have what in Spain would be a
snack. The meal deal, sold in badulaque-type shops, is very famous
here. A curious word, by the way: badulaque. I think it's
invented. The meal deal consists of choosing from a wide variety of
sandwiches, plus a bag of chips and a snack, for 3 pounds. That's what
they eat here. In some shops, in addition to sandwiches, they also
offer small boxes with prepared dishes—usually pasta—mini
wraps/kebabs, or salads. Right outside the office, there's a square
where they set up a food market on Thursdays, with stalls serving
homemade food (although everything is very exotic, usually Asian or
Arabic. We already know that traditional English cuisine
is… scarce). I'll try something and tell you, although I'm scared
because everything is usually quite spicy. By spicy, I don't mean the
spicy kind you get in Spain. Spicy as hell. Curry or chili.

And then they have dinner at 7:00 PM, of course. Normally, they
haven't eaten all day, and by the time they get off work, they're
hungrier than Carpanta. Anyway, this time isn't as bad as it seems at
first. I'll see how I adapt, and I'll keep you posted. For now, I
think I know why it's like this. In Spain, I roughly knew what time it
was by the sunlight. Not by the position of the sun, but by the
light. You've all noticed that the light in the early morning is
different from that at noon, and in the afternoon. Well, here… let's
just say there's no "midday light." All morning you have that feeling
of "morning," and then suddenly it's "afternoon." And it's a super
long afternoon, until suddenly it gets dark. And it's not like in
Spain, where it gets dark and you're still a bit lively. No. Here it
gets dark, and at 7 p.m. you have the same feeling as at 10 p.m. in
Spain. So, it's normal that they have the time they have.

Bristol is full of seagulls. It catches my attention because it's a
coastal city, but it doesn't feel like it. It's a bit strange. It's
not on the coast, like Almería, for example. But it does have a river
(the River Avon, by the way, the cosmetics river), which flows into a
fairly large canal. I don't know, it's strange. But there are a lot of
seagulls. Everywhere. Especially around McDonald's at closing
time. There are also quite a few pigeons, as usual; but sparrows I
haven't seen one yet. Funny.

There's another silly thing that caught my attention, and that is that
on TV, when they show a movie or series, they show all the
credits. Right up to the end. In Spain, we know they don't have time
to cut them and run commercials, and if they did, no one would pay
attention, okay. But here they do. And well, if you think about
it… all those people have worked on it, and they deserve their
recognition. So it's not so bad at all.

Bristolians have a broken thermostat. That's assuming they have
one. In Spain, people dress more or less the same: when it's cold we
all take out our coats, and when it's hot, we show our skin. Here,
everyone does their own thing. The day I arrived, or rather, the night
I arrived, the pilot reported a temperature of 3°C. As I left the
airport, I noticed it. Quite a chill. Polo liquor. Well, on the street
you could find people walking around in short sleeves. That's how they
play here.

The plugs are pretty well thought out (except where to put them, [as I
already mentioned][flat]). And I've had to study it too, of course,
so I can plug in Spanish things here. All the plugs, absolutely all of
them, have a switch. If you don't flip the switch, you'll look like an
idiot waiting for your gadget to work. They all also have little
protective tabs (well, this is also common in Spain, especially on
power strips. I haven't seen it as often on the wall). The tabs open
when you insert the ground plug, which is the top pin, the one that's
vertical. It's a little longer than the other two, precisely for that,
to open the tabs on the other two pins.

Well, sorry for the disorganized and unstructured post, but there were
a lot of loose things, too small for a post on their own. And too
disparate to put a few together in one post. So I put them all
together and this mess came out.
