One of the things I had yet to do in Bristol was go hot-air
ballooning.  Every year in the summer, at the beginning of August, the
[_Bristol International Balloon Fiesta_][fiesta] is organized, a
four-day event where participants from all over the UK and around the
world bring their balloons to Bristol. Aside from music, a fair, food,
and drinks, there are two "ascents" a day. Plus, almost year-round
(except in winter), as long as it's not too windy, you can see some
balloons flying over Bristol. So, as one of the "local attractions," I
had to try it.

To start with, it's not cheap. If you're curious, you can look up
prices online. But the worst part is that it's not easy. When you buy
the ticket, it's valid for a year, and you have to choose which day
you want to fly. You go to the website and book. And you cross your
fingers and pray to Aeolus and the [FSM] that the flight isn't
canceled. Because it's canceled. If the wind blows a little faster
than you can ride your bike, don't expect to fly. So you have to try
and try until you get it. And the bad thing is that you won't have
confirmation until a few hours before, so you can't plan your day.

Once they finally say yes, that you're going to fly, you have to go to
the takeoff site, of course. In Bristol, it's from the same spot as
the _Balloon Fiesta_, at Ashton Court ([where the deer][deer]). Since
each of those balloons are **enormous**, everyone has to help unfold it
on the ground and inflate it. Once unfolded, two guys hold the _mouth_
of the balloon while two powerful fans blow air into it as if there
were no tomorrow. It seems unbelievable, but most of the work is done
by the fans; it inflates much more than I expected just from that.

When it's fully inflated, the pilot turns on the burners and begins to
heat the air inside, so it rises, and then the fans are turned
off. When it's finally vertical, we jump into the basket and prepare
for takeoff. I was really struck by how smooth the takeoff was, barely
noticeable. And yet, before we knew it, we were already at about 1,000
meters above sea level! Just like that.

After that… you're at the mercy of the wind. If there's no wind, you
don't move. And that's what happened to us. We stood still, or almost
stood still, for a long time, long enough to start wondering what
would happen if the wind didn't blow again. Especially because we were
no longer above the takeoff area, but above the river canyon.

Luckily—and as expected—the wind blew again, and we began traveling
northeast. We were able to see many things from above, and then we
descended to fly over the city. In fact, we perhaps swooped down too
far: at one point we were about 4 or 5 meters above the
streetlights. People heard the sound of the burner (they were already
familiar with it) and came out of their houses to say hello,
especially the children. Oh, and the dogs. The dogs were hilarious
because they started barking and running around. I don't think they
like balloons. At a certain height, I looked out over the city and it
was like playing SimCity.

During the flight, the pilot told us that it was traditional to carry
a bottle of champagne in the balloons. The first aeronauts in history
[celebrated their first flight with a champagne toast][brindis], and
this tradition has continued ever since, so he uncorked a couple of
bottles (there were 16 of us). There was also orange juice, in case
anyone didn't want alcohol. Or wanted to mix them and make a mimosa.

After a while, the pilot spotted a field full of cows and decided it
was a good place to land. Landing is the opposite of taking off. And
I'm not saying this because it's obvious. I say it because it's not
smooth. Not smooth at all. The basket hit the ground and bounced a few
times, dragged by the balloon's inertia, until it finally
stopped. Luckily, we didn't capsize.

As always, here's the photo album and some videos.
