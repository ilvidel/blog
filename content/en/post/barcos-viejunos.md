Today I'm bringing you an advertorial about giant machinery, ships,
and technical advances in the 18th century. I should have been born
150 years ago, when everything was new and there were innovations
every week. Anyway, when I get my time machine working, I'll be happy.

The fact is, I went for a walk around Bristol's harbourside. It's a
river port, like Seville, and the River Avon is quite wide and easy to
navigate. The first ship I came across was the [HSM
Atherstone][atherstone], a minesweeper that just spent three years in
the Persian Gulf and returned in December. It normally docks in
Portsmouth, but is now in Bristol—I don't know why.

The port is a very cool place to walk. It is quite old, and you can
imagine what it was like in its golden age. In the header image of
this post, you can see (if I haven't been too creative with the visual
effects) the cranes used to load and unload cargo from ships. They are
three rather imposing cranes, which moved on rails, which are still in
the ground. These same rails were used by the railroad, so they could
transfer cargo directly from the ship to the train (or vice
versa). Now a train also uses them, although a slightly different one:

Continuing with the walk, and Completely unexpectedly, I came across
the replica of the *Matthew* (whose existence we learned about during
our visit to [St. Mary Redcliffe Church][stlmary], if you
recall). There, we learned that it was the ship John Cabbot used to
travel to America in 1497, arriving in Newfoundland—and beginning the
colonization of North America, while Columbus toured the Caribbean and
Central America.

# El Matthew

A visit to the Matthew is highly recommended. First, because it's free
(although donations are appreciated), and second, because you learn
many interesting things that you don't learn in school. For example,
it's surprising how small the ship is. It's a wooden boat, about 20
meters long and no more than 5 or 6 meters wide. When you think of
crossing the ocean on a boat, you usually think of… a beautiful
boat. Big. Sturdy. And this is a small boat, a nutshell that bobbed
with the slight movement of the calm water in the canal. And yet, it
crosses the ocean in 50 days. Under sail. I don't know, it's quite
impressive to think about that and see it in person. When you think
about Columbus's voyage, you don't really get a sense of what that
must have been like; it must have taken some serious guts. And even
more so, without knowing how long it would take. Now you're saying,
well, I'll take provisions and supplies for 50 days. But Columbus
didn't know how long it would take (some historian will correct
me). Or the Vikings, who are supposed to have [arrived in America much
earlier][america] (although, being so brute, they didn't stop and
write history or make maps, so it's not very clear).

They let you wander around almost the entire ship, go down to the
hold, see where they sleep, how the rudder works… Very cool. There
are several documents that explain how things worked on the ship in
the 15th/16th century. There are even small cannons that I don't know
if they're real, or if they've just put them on the replica for
decoration/for tourists.

I was talking to one of the crew members, who are all volunteers and
maintain the ship thanks to donations. He told me a little about
Cabott's history and voyages, and told me that the ship is fully
operational! They do public trips around the harbor, along the Avon
Gorge (under the [Clifton Suspension Bridge][bridge]), and sometimes
they cross the pond (I don't know why this last one). I might take one
of the trips some weekend. It's a must. This is the way. See some more
[photos of the Matthew][matthew] on Flickr.

# El SS Great Britain

{{< big-figure src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5578/30599518514_d1219d5e72_z.jpg" >}}

After this unexpected and instructive stop, I continued my journey
until I reached my true destination: the ocean liner [SS Great
Britain][ssgreatbritain]. Now transformed into a museum ship and
parked in exactly the same [dry dock][drydock] where it was built in
1843, it was once, at 100 m long and 15 m wide, the largest
ocean-going passenger ship in the world. It was designed by Brunel
(the same one who built the [Clifton Suspension Bridge][bridge], I
already told you about it) and was a kind of experiment in building a
metal ship. In fact, it was the first metal ocean liner, which is why
it was the largest: a metal hull is harder and thinner than a wooden
one, which allowed him to build a larger ship. It also has the largest
wooden masts ever built. All this allowed it to transport up to 360
passengers and 130 crew members from Liverpool to New York in just 14
days (remember the 53 days of the *Matthew*).

It made several voyages between England and the United States until,
in 1847, a violent storm caused it to run aground in Dundrum Bay,
Ireland. The cost of salvaging it bankrupted the *Great Western
Steamship Company*, the company to which it belonged, and they had to
sell it to another company, which transformed it into an emigration
ship: they added a new deck to increase its capacity to 730
passengers, which it regularly transported between the United Kingdom
and Australia.

In 1886, its decline began. A fire on board caused extensive damage,
and it was sold to the *Falkland Islands Company*, where it remained
for 51 years, used exclusively as a coal store. How sad, and what a
waste. I suppose that's when the company closed, or something like
that, and they got rid of the ship by drilling holes in the hull,
leaving it to sink and corrode.

In the 1970s, the British were determined to bring it home, and
organized a salvage operation to refloat it and bring it to Bristol
under tow on a pontoon. You can watch the story in a BBC documentary
on YouTube: [Chronicle - The Great Iron Ship][chronicle] I highly
recommend it (although it's in English, of course).


It's now fully restored, just as it was on its initial passenger
voyages. The hull was badly corroded, so they decided to leave it in
[dry dock][drydock] to prevent further rot. In fact, the dock is
sealed below the waterline and has a ventilation system that injects
dry air to counteract the usual high humidity.

Walking around the hull allows you to see that, although it's
extensively restored, it still has many holes and corroded areas,
giving you an idea of how it was found. The bow has the typical shape
we all recognize now, but it turns out this was the first boat built
that way. You can also see the propeller and rudder, another
innovation now incorporated into all boats and which began with this
one.

{{< figure src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5551/31051669070_e4a9500da9_z.jpg"
footer="The propeller is a replica of the original" >}}

After seeing the dock and the hull, I went up to the main deck. It was
a bit dull, to be honest, although I suppose it was designed to be
elegant so that passengers could get some fresh air and not spend two
weeks locked on the lower decks (quite cramped, by the way). There are
replicas of small stables/barns for transporting animals. Apparently,
they also have activities for children, and they are allowed to climb
the masts using the rigging boards.

Since it started to rain (even though it was such a strong sun when I
left home that I had to leave my jacket behind), I went down to the
promenade deck. Here you'll find the captain's cabin, as well as the
first-class passengers' cabins (in the stern) and the second-class
cabins in the bow. The cabins are very, very narrow, as are the
beds. I suppose that at that time, no one was taller than 1.60 meters,
because otherwise, it would be very difficult for me to sleep.

By the way, those gentlemen you see in the photos are dolls. The ship
is not only restored, but also decorated as if it were on a
voyage. There are several mannequins scattered throughout the ship,
representing passengers, crew, the doctor, the barber, the
captain… On this deck, you can also see part of the engine working,
the "toilets," and several suitcases scattered about haphazardly.

Further down is the second deck. In the stern area, under the cabins,
is the main saloon, where meals were served. In the middle area,
around the engine, are the galley and bakery, and some lockers for
storing luggage. In the stern is the cargo hold, where both cargo and
animals were stored.


Finally, I'll leave you with a short video with some things I
recorded (nothing really coherent, to be honest). Of course, you can
see more photos on [Flickr][flickr]. I appreciate it if you comment on
Twitter or tell me something directly, so I know you're reading me and
that you like it (or not).
