Today's post is going to be short, at least in text. I went to see how
the Bristol Canal locks work. Within the city, the river divides in
two: one part follows the natural course of the river, and another
part leads to a fairly long canal, which is where the harbourside is
located. This canal is always full of water (that is, regardless of
the tides).

To achieve this, they obviously had to close it and separate it from
the river. But they must allow ships to enter and exit the river. And
how do they do it? Well, with a system of locks, just like the Panama
Canal, only on a smaller scale. Here's a video showing how it works.
