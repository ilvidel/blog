As soon as we landed, my friend Cleto picked me up at the airport and
took me straight to a pub called *The Steam Crane*, without stopping
at my house. We got a bit lost in the streets because, despite it
being a huge city of 400,000 inhabitants (not counting seagulls), it
feels like a fucking village. Narrow, poorly laid-out, poorly lit
streets, all the houses the same. Suddenly, you've accidentally
stumbled into a dead end—literally—and you have to turn back... In
short, a labyrinth. But we finally arrived, and his wife and more
Spaniards, who are also working in Bristol, were waiting for us. So,
to celebrate my arrival, we had a few pints.

The next day, or rather, the next night, we went to another pub, this
time more central and by the river. *The Brew Dog*. There, we met a
Greek boy and girl, an Italian, a Romanian, and an Australian. Javi
(one of the Spaniards from the day before) and I spent a good while
talking with the Australian. He was a very interesting guy, and, truth
be told, he talked a lot. It's easier to have a conversation that way,
haha.

Another pub around here that's quite famous is the [Llandoger
Trow][llandoger]. It's famous not for its beer, but for its history,
as it has been a drinking spot for two famous writers. Apparently,
[Daniel Defoe][defoe] met [Alexander Selkirk][selkirk] here, who would
serve as inspiration for the character of [Robinson
Crusoe][crusoe]. It was also seen there, although about two centuries
later, by [Robert Louis Stevenson][stevenson], who based his *Admiral
Belbow Inn* in this pub, for his novel [Treasure Island][treasure].

By the way, the word "pub" is quite funny. It turns out it comes from a
shortening of the original name "Public House." They weren't actually
public houses, but rather houses where alcohol and spirits were sold
to the public. What a sight.

There's a pub we go to quite a lot after work, mainly because it's
close by. It's called *Yurt Lush*, and I really like it because it's
like several wooden huts joined together, and each one has a stove in
the center. It's all made of wood and it's quite cool and very
cozy. Aside from drinks, they apparently also serve food (well, like
all pubs), and I think they do good English
[breakfasts][breakfast]. I'll have to go there one day for breakfast
(I've been thinking about it for a while, but I'm always too lazy to
leave the house without breakfast. And early, of course, because 10 or
11 a.m. isn't breakfast time here. I'll have to go on a weekday).
