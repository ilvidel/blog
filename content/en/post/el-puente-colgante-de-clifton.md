Today I took a short excursion: I took a bus and went to visit the
[Clifton Suspension Bridge][bridge]. It was opened in 1864 to cross the Avon
Gorge and connect the Clifton neighborhood (Bristol) with Leigh Woods
(North Somerset), and it's one of Bristol's symbols. Anyway, you can
read all this information on [Wikipedia][wikipedia]. I'll tell you about my
excursion; it actually has three parts: in addition to the bridge, I
found a camera obscura and a cave that could be visited. So, as *Jack
the Ripper* said, let's go by parts.

# The Observatory And The Bridge

I took a bus and, like any good tourist, I went up to the top floor to
sit by the window, in the front row (yes, here too, they have two
decks, although they're not red like the ones in London). The buses,
by the way, have a PA system like the Underground, which announces the
next stop. Very useful for those who are lost, like me. They also have
a little screen, in case you're deaf, that shows you the name of the
stop. But the best part isn't that: from time to time, they release a
burst of air freshener to neutralize the smell of humanity. It's all
very modern. After about 30 or 40 minutes, at bus pace, I arrived at
the observatory park. The observatory of the bridge and the gorge, not
the astronomical one. It smelled like barbecue, although I couldn't
find who was cooking it. It's funny that they let them have barbecues
in the park, but of course, since they live in the humidity and
rain... I also found an ice cream van!

So, I finally arrived at the observatory, which, like any good
observatory, is on top of a hill. Apparently, there were several
things up there in medieval times, although nothing remains. Now,
there's only a very beautiful park, full of grass, and a small
building, which we'll see later. You can walk along the river gorge
for about 100 or 200 meters and see the bridge and the whole
landscape. It's all very, very beautiful. The bridge itself is quite
impressive. Apparently, engineers students learn about it in Uni and
it's said they could have made it with three times less material. So,
it's not going to fall down.

The truth is, the bridge is quite impressive. Look at the size of the
two structures at each end (I don't know the technical name, please
forgive me, architects and civil engineers), compared to the cars and
people. Very impressive. One of the main driving forces behind the
bridge, as well as its designer, was a certain [Brunel][brunel], who
is something of a local hero around here. Many things bear his name,
either because he built them or in his honor. Of course, when you can
save money on labor by being a slave owner, the perspective
changes. But hey, that's what it was back then.

# The Dark Chamber

The structure I was telling you about is a stone building that houses
the visitor center, with its information office, a bar, and a small
tower in which a [camera obscura][camera] is installed. At the top of
the tower is a small, completely dark room. On the ceiling, there is a
rotating device with a 13cm lens and a mirror. It was installed there
by William West (a local artist) in 1829. Artists used the camera
obscura regularly to paint more realistically. In other words,
tracing.

Light enters through the lens, and the mirror redirects it and
projects it onto a flat, white surface. When you open the door to the
room, you can't see anything, but when the room goes dark, you can see
the surroundings projected onto the board. This is the principle
behind cameras. The device has a crank that you can turn to point it
in one direction or another, so you can see the entire surroundings.

The [Tavira Tower][Tavira] in Cádiz also houses a camera obscura, in
case you'd like to visit. I made a video inside the chamber to show
you, but nothing was visible; it was all black. The light projected
onto the table isn't bright enough for the cameras (mine, at
least). There's more information on the [Clifton
Observatory][Observatory] page.

# The Giants' Cave

Inside the observatory is also the entrance to "The Giant's Cave."
According to popular folklore, two giants named Goram and Ghyston once
lived in Bristol, and their home was in this cave. It was also
occupied during the Roman period, as pottery remains from that period
have been found, and in the XVII century (that's 17th, for those who
can't read Roman) it served as a refuge for a hermit.

The cave isn't really that big, at least not the part that can be
visited. I seem to recall there was a closed path. From the
observatory building, you go down a series of stairs—quite uneven, by
the way—and enter the earth. You go down and down and down, through a
narrow tunnel. To give you an idea, at some points I had to lie down
on the stairs and slide down because I couldn't fit. Eventually, you
reach a viewpoint overlooking one side of the gorge. Then you have to
climb back up, crawling up the stairs and praying that no one comes
down while you're climbing. When you finally come out, your legs are
sore. It's part of the visit. Here's a video of the descent. You can
see more pictures on [Flickr][Flickr].
